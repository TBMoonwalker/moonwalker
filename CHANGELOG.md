# Changelog

All notable changes to Moonwalker are documented in this file.

## [1.0.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Persist EMA swing lows by symbol and timeframe so restart recovery can continue higher-low tracking safely.
- Add direct regression coverage for Control Center setup-entry history state and EMA swing recovery edge cases.

### Changed

- Reconstruct the latest qualifying EMA swing low from recent candle history when persisted restart state is missing.

### Fixed

- Preserve first-run Control Center setup-entry choices in browser history so Back and Forward stay inside the setup flow instead of dropping to a blank page.

## [1.0.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed

- Let the expanded open-trade chart use the full card surface while preserving rounded clipping.
- Make selected tabs and primary actions read clearly active across Control Center, Monitoring, Utilities, and Trades.
- Give the trades tab row the same line-style active treatment as the profit tabs.
