# Dependency management

Moonwalker uses reproducible dependency locks and fails closed when an
automated install encounters an unreviewed artifact or lifecycle hook.

## Runtime baseline

- Python `3.14.x`; `.python-version` records the verified patch release.
- Node.js `24.x` LTS; `.nvmrc` records the verified patch release and npm
  enforces the supported range from `frontend/package.json`.
- npm `11.x`.
- TA-Lib's Python wheel is pinned in the backend lock. The system TA-Lib
  installation remains an operating-system prerequisite where a compatible
  wheel is unavailable.

`./run.sh start` checks this runtime before creating the service lock. If a
newer Node.js release is active, select the repository version with nvm on
macOS or Linux:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
./run.sh start
```

On macOS, Homebrew can provide the same isolated Node.js 24 runtime:

```bash
brew install node@24
export PATH="$(brew --prefix node@24)/bin:$PATH"
./run.sh start
```

The Python locks are compiled for Python 3.14. Regenerate them with the target
runtime whenever the supported Python minor version changes.

## Updating Python packages

Edit the direct inputs, then compile both hash-locked dependency graphs:

```bash
./scripts/compile_requirements.sh
```

- `backend/requirements.in` contains production inputs.
- `backend/requirements-dev.in` adds development and audit tools.
- `backend/requirements.txt` and `backend/requirements-dev.txt` are generated;
  do not edit them manually.

The compiler version is pinned inside the script. Runtime and CI installs use
`--require-hashes` and `--only-binary=:all:`. This verifies every downloaded
artifact and prevents arbitrary source-distribution build hooks from running.

Telethon's `pyaes 1.6.1` dependency is the sole upstream package without a
published wheel. Its locked source archive and inert `distutils.setup()` file
were reviewed, then built twice with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1505942274`; both builds
produced the committed pure-Python wheel with SHA-256
`97e69519924dde9254b26b20fe37eebb4a6b811d6bda4945a53fba04a4188a83`.
The installer verifies that hash and installs the wheel with `--no-index` and
`--no-deps` before processing the main wheel-only lock. CI and startup therefore
never execute the upstream source build.

## Updating frontend packages

Keep every direct version exact in `frontend/package.json`, then regenerate the
lock without executing dependency scripts:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
npm ci --ignore-scripts
```

`frontend/.npmrc` makes exact saves, engine checks, and disabled lifecycle
scripts the defaults. The lock policy accepts only the public npm registry,
requires SHA-512 integrity metadata, and allows install-script metadata only
for the reviewed `rete@2.0.6` banner and optional `fsevents@2.3.3` native hook.
Neither hook executes in Moonwalker automation.

## Security verification

Run the focused audit or the full CI suite:

```bash
./scripts/audit_dependencies.sh
cd scripts && ./ci.sh
```

The checks include Python and npm vulnerability databases, npm registry
signatures, exact root pins, registry origin, artifact integrity, the lifecycle
hook allowlist, tests, type checks, linting, and production builds. Review all
major updates and newly introduced packages before changing a lock file.

### Temporary CCXT/setuptools exception

CCXT `4.5.67` hard-pins `setuptools 82.0.1`. That setuptools release is listed
under `PYSEC-2026-3447` because a Unicode-normalization edge case can cause an
excluded file to enter a source distribution built on macOS. Moonwalker does
not build or publish source distributions, and both runtime and CI installs
enforce wheel-only artifacts, so the affected code path is unreachable.

The audit ignores only `PYSEC-2026-3447`. Remove the exception and upgrade to
`setuptools >=83.0.0` as soon as CCXT relaxes its exact pin. No other audit
finding is allowlisted.

## Rollback

Revert the dependency-only changeset and rerun `./run.sh start`. Startup builds
and validates the inactive environment slot before changing the `.venv`
symlink. The predecessor remains at `.venv.previous`, and a failed dependency
install or import check never changes the active environment.
